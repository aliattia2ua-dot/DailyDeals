# Android Build Configuration for React Native Firebase

Since the `android` folder doesn't exist yet (it will be generated by `expo prebuild`), here are the configurations that need to be applied after running `npx expo prebuild --clean`:

## 1. android/build.gradle

Add to the `buildscript` → `dependencies` block:

```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // ... existing dependencies
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0'
        classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.9'
    }
}
```

## 2. android/app/build.gradle

Add at the **bottom** of the file:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

## 3. android/app/google-services.json

Place your downloaded `google-services.json` file here.

**Download from:** Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Android App → Download google-services.json

## Important Notes

- These configurations are typically handled automatically by Expo when you use `expo-dev-client` and configure the app.json properly
- React Native Firebase modules will auto-link with Expo
- After adding google-services.json, always run: `npx expo prebuild --clean`
- For manual native builds, ensure the gradle plugins are added as shown above

## Verification

After setup, run:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew :app:dependencies

# Look for firebase dependencies
```

You should see React Native Firebase packages listed in the dependency tree.
